My family, originally hailing from Jordan, moved to Sweden in 1989 where I grew up, but I spent most of my childhood summers in Saudi Arabia with my wider family.

**Grannie Teta**, known for her exquisite food and warm hospitality, was one of the most influential characters in my life and, thanks to her, wholesome Arabic home cooking was at the heart of my upbringing. It’s what I missed the most when I moved to London for Uni in 2008.

In 2019, I quit my corporate job to embark on my biggest adventure yet – bringing Wanasa to life. The aim is simple:

> Introduce London to authentic Arabic home cooking, giving you a taste of the delicacies of Grannie Teta’s table, in a beautiful and relaxed setting, with a touch of the Scandinavian cafe culture I grew up with.

So…I hope you enjoy! We use the freshest ingredients and best producers, mainly from the Levant region, comprising Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Palestine. Our specials also showcase favourite childhood dishes from other Arabic countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Algeria.

Shukran!

Hiyam
