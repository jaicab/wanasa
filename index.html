          Manaeesh is one of the most delicious things you can try in the Middle
          East. These thin flatbreads are baked until golden and sizzling and
          are traditionally topped with Palestinian Akkawi cheese or the herb
          and spice mix za’atar and olive oil, giving an earthy, nutty and tangy
          taste. At Wanasa, we also serve a delicious chilli topping, a unique
          family recipe that has been developed over many years, as well as a
          meat topping, using high-quality locally sourced beef and lamb. These
          can be enjoyed for breakfast with a cup of strong tea or throughout
          the day as a snack!

          <p class="">Hi there<br /></p>
          <p>
            My name is Hiyam and I am excited to welcome you to Wanasa
            (pronounced One-asa)! My family, originally hailing from Jordan,
            moved to Sweden in 1989 where I grew up, however I spent most of my
            childhood summers in Saudi Arabia with my wider family. Grannie
            Teta, known for her exquisite food and warm hospitality, was one of
            the most influential characters in my life, and, thanks to her,
            wholesome Arabic home cooking was at the heart of my upbringing.
            This is what I missed the most when I moved to London for university
            in 2008.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2019, I quit my corporate job to embark on my biggest adventure
            yet – bringing Wanasa to life. The aim is simple:
          </p>
          <p>
            Introduce London to authentic Arabic home cooking, giving you a
            taste of the delicacies of Grannie Teta’s table, in a beautiful and
            relaxed setting, with a touch of the Scandinavian cafe culture I
            grew up with.
          </p>
          <p>
            So…I hope you enjoy! We use the freshest ingredients sourced from
            the best producers to bring our family recipes to you. These are
            mainly from the Levant region, comprising Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and
            Palestine, but our specials also showcase favourite childhood dishes
            from other Arabic countries, like Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Algeria.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wanasa means connecting with people in humble settings, usually with
            food and music involved. It is a unique Arabic word with no direct
            translation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shukran!<br />
